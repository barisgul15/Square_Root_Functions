# Square_Root_Functions
Different algorithms are combined to calculate the square root of a number and compared with default C library function regarding execution time and accuracy.

Compile with gcc sqrt_test.c -o <name> and execute ./<name> to see the results of the time and accuracy comparrions. 

Note: To get a better results for all test, test are executed for every algorithm from 0 to INT_MAX and also for the time calculations test that process in repeated 5 times for each process, so it may take some time to execute the tests.
